Sounds
======

Sandhi is an important part of Sanskrit. Thus sandhi is an important part of
the Ashtadhyayi. The metalanguage of the Ashtadhyayi gives us a few ways to
describe different groups of sounds as tersely as possible.

*Savarṇa* sets
--------------

First, a way to describe related sounds:

    Vowels and semivowels, as well as consonants with *u* as an *it* letter,
    refer to all **savarṇa** ("homogeneous") terms. (1.1.69)

*Savarṇa* has a precise definition, but generally it refers to sounds that are
similar in some way. Anyway, some examples:

- *a* refers to *a* and *ā*
- *i* refers to *i* and *ī*
- *ku* refers to all sounds in *kavarga*
- *cu* refers to all sounds in *cavarga*

*a* and *i* also refer to the corresponding nasal vowels, but generally we can
ignore the nasal sounds entirely. (The rule mentions semivowels because some
semivowels can be nasal, too.)

Single vowels
-------------
In the grammar, *a* always refers to both *a* and *ā*. To refer to just the
sound *a*, we use the following rule:

    A vowel stated with *t* refers to just that vowel. (1.1.70)

Some examples:

- *at* refers to just *a*
- *āt* refers to just *ā*

These terms refer to nasal sounds too, but generally we can ignore the nasal
sounds entirely.

*Pratyāhāra*
------------
Finally, a way to refer to other groups of interest. Consider the following
list:

    1. a i u **ṇ**
    2. ṛ ḷ **k**
    3. e o **ṅ**
    4. ai au **c**
    5. ha ya va ra **ṭ**
    6. la **ṇ**
    7. ña ma ṅa ṇa na **m**
    8. jha bha **ñ**
    9. gha ḍha dha **ṣ**
    10. ja ba ga ḍa da **ś**
    11. kha pha cha ṭha tha ca ṭa ta **v**
    12. ka pa **y**
    13. śa ṣa sa **r**
    14. ha **l**

These rows are usually called the **Shiva Sutras**. They were arranged
deliberately so that similar sounds would appear next to each other.

Here's how we use the list. Each row has a list of sounds that ends with an
*it* tag. We take advantage of the following metarule:

    In lists like the one above, an item stated with an *it* refers to all
    the items between them, too. (1.1.71)

and use it to produce concise terms for various Sanskrit sounds.

For example, the *ha* on row 5, when used with *it* letter *l* on row 14,
creates the term *hal*. And this *hal* refers to all sounds between *ha* and
that *it* letter *l*. That is, it refers to the set of Sanskrit consonants.

Such groups are called **pratyāhāra**. Other examples:

- *ac* refers to all vowels. By rule 1.1.69, *a* refers to *ā*, and so on for
  the other vowels.
- *khar* refers to all unvoiced consonants.
- *yaṇ* refers to all semivowels.
- *al* refers to all sounds.

Certain sounds and *it* letters are used in the list twice, but context is
enough to tell us how to interpret a given *pratyāhāra*.
