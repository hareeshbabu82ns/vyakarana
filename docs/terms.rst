Terms and Data
==============

The input to an ordinary rule is a list of *terms*. Here we define what
terms are and what they contain.

Throughout this section, our working example will be *ca + kṛ + a*.


Sounds
------

Our example has three terms, each of which represents a piece of sound.
I state that for the sake of completeness, but really it's self-evident.


*Saṃjñā*
--------

What's not self-evident is that each term has a variety of designations
(*saṃjñā*) associated with it. These *saṃjñā*, which are assigned by the
Ashtadhyayi itself, enable some rules and block others. This process guides
the original input toward the desired results.

Our example uses the following *saṃjñā*:

===============  =============  ====================
ca               kṛ             a
===============  =============  ====================
:term:`abhyāsa`  :term:`dhātu`  :term:`pratyaya`
_                _              :term:`vibhakti`
_                _              :term:`tiṅ`
_                _              :term:`ārdhadhātuka`
===============  =============  ====================

In addition, *ca + kṛ* together are called both :term:`abhyasta` and
:term:`aṅga`.


:term:`it` letters
------------------

The Ashtadhyayi also has a second set of designations. These are the **it**
letters. They are attached to a term:

    *ḍukṛñ*

then removed by applying some metarules (1.3.2 - 1.3.9). Whatever remains is
the value of interest:

    *ḍukṛñ → ḍu kṛ ñ → kṛ*

The *it* letters are stated with the word *it* after them. Thus *ḍvit* and
*ñit*. A group of sounds stated with its *it* letters is called its
**upadeśa**.

Think of these letters as "tags" on the original value. Just a shirt might have
a label that tells us how to wash it, a term might have *it* letters that tell
us how it behaves in certain contexts. *it* letters are not letters in any
meaningful sense, and they have no meaning outside of the metalanguage of the
Ashtadhyayi.

Usage and examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *it* letters are basically just *saṃjñā*. *ḍvit* allows *kṛ* to take a
certain suffix, and *ñit* allows *kṛ* to use both :term:`parasmaipada` and
:term:`ātmanepada` endings in its verbs.

*it* letters have a huge impact on which forms are derived. If the *upadeśa*
of the suffix *a* is just *a*, the resulting word will be *cakra*. If the
*upadeśa* of the suffix *a* is *ṇal*, the suffix has *ṇit*, which strengthens
the root vowel and produces the word *cakāra*.

The :ref:`glossary <it-glossary>` describes the most common *it* letters.
