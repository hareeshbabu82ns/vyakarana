Terms and Data
==============

The input to an ordinary rule is a list of *terms*. Here we define what
terms are and what they contain.

Throughout this section, our working example will be *ca + kṛ + a*.


Sounds
------

Our example has three terms, each of which represents a piece of sound.
I state that for the sake of completeness, but really it's self-evident.


*Saṃjñā*
--------

What's not self-evident is that each term has a variety of designations
(*saṃjñā*) associated with it. These *saṃjñā*, which are assigned by the
Ashtadhyayi itself, enable some rules and block others. This process guides
the original input toward the desired results.

Our example uses the following *saṃjñā*:

===============  =============  ====================
ca               kṛ             a
===============  =============  ====================
:term:`abhyāsa`  :term:`dhātu`  :term:`pratyaya`
_                _              :term:`vibhakti`
_                _              :term:`tiṅ`
_                _              :term:`ārdhadhātuka`
===============  =============  ====================

In addition, *ca + kṛ* together are called both :term:`abhyasta` and
:term:`aṅga`.


*it* letters
------------

The Ashtadhyayi also has a second set of designations. These are called **it**
letters. They are attached to a term:

    *ḍukṛñ*

then removed by applying certain metarules, which are described further below.
Whatever remains is the value of interest:

    *ḍukṛñ → ḍu kṛ ñ → kṛ*

The *it* letters are stated with the word *it* after them. Thus *ḍvit* and
*ñit*. A group of sounds stated with its *it* letters is called its
**upadeśa**.

Think of an *it* as a "tag" on the original value. Just a shirt might have
a label that tells us how to wash it, a term might have an *it* that tells
us how it behaves in certain contexts.

*it* letters are not letters in any meaningful sense, and they have no meaning
outside of the metalanguage of the Ashtadhyayi.

Rules
^^^^^

For some term T, the following are *it* letters:

- nasal vowels (1.3.2)
- at the end of T:

  - consonants (1.3.3)
  - but not {*t, th, d, dh, n, s, m*} when T is a :term:`vibhakti` (1.3.4)

- at the beginning of T:

  - *ñi*, *ṭu*, and *ḍu* (1.3.5)

- at the beginning of T, if T is a :term:`pratyaya`:

  - *ṣ* (1.3.6)
  - *c, ch, j, jh, ñ, ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh, ṇ* (1.3.7)
  - *l, ś, k, kh, g, gh, ṅ* if not a *taddhita* suffix

Usage and examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *it* letters are basically just *saṃjñā*. *ḍvit* allows *kṛ* to take a
certain suffix, and *ñit* allows *kṛ* to use both :term:`parasmaipada` and
:term:`ātmanepada` endings in its verbs.

*it* letters have a huge impact on which forms are derived. If the *upadeśa*
of the suffix *a* is just *a*, the resulting word will be *cakra*. If the
*upadeśa* of the suffix *a* is *ṇal*, the suffix has *ṇit*, which strengthens
the root vowel and produces the word *cakāra*.

The :ref:`glossary <it-glossary>` describes the most common *it* letters and
the roles they perform.
