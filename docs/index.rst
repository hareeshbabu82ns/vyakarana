Vyakarana Documentation
=======================

This is the documentation for Vyakarana, a program that derives Sanskrit words.
To get the most out of the documentation, you should have a working knowledge
of Sanskrit.

.. important::
    All data handled by the system is represented in `SLP1`_. SLP1 also uses
    the following symbols:

    - ``'\\'`` to indicate *anudātta*
    - ``'^'`` to indicate *svarita*
    - ``'~'`` to indicate a nasal sound

    Unmarked vowels are *udātta*.
