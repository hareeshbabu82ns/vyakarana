    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Code to convert a list of :class:`~vyakarana.template.RuleStub`
    objects into a list of :class:`~vyakarana.rules.Rule` objects.

    This code does only the most basic sort of inference. It takes a
    stub and uses the previous rule (and the current Anuvrtti) to fill
    in any gaps.

    For more complex inference, see :mod:`vyakarana.trees`.

    TODO: think of better name for this module
