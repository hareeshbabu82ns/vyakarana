    There are roughly 4000 rules in the Ashtadhyayi, almost all of which
    define operations on some input sequence. Since any of these rules
    could apply at any given moment, we must check all R rules against
    each state. And since a rule could apply to any of the T terms within
    a state, we must check against all terms as well. This leaves us with
    RT candidates for each state.

    By arranging rules hierarchically, we greatly reduce the number of
    comparisons we have to make. Rule selection becomes roughly log(RT).
