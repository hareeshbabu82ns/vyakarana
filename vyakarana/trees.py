    There are roughly 4000 rules in the Ashtadhyayi, almost all of which

    could apply at any given moment, we must check all R rules against
    each state. And since a rule could apply to any of the T terms within
    a state, we must check against all terms as well. This leaves us with
    RT candidates for each state.

    By arranging rules hierarchically, we greatly reduce the number of
