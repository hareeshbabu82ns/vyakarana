    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Excluding paribhāṣā, all rules in the Ashtadhyayi describe a context
    then specify an operation to apply based on that context. Within
    this simulator, a rule's context is defined using *filters*, which
    return a true or false value for a given index within some state.

    This module defines a variety of parameterized and unparameterized
    filters, as well as as some basic operators for combining filters.

    Most of the grammar's rules have preconditions. For example, the
    rule that inserts suffix *śnam* applies only if the input contains
    a root in the *rudh* group. This class makes it easy to define
    these preconditions and ensure that rules apply in their proper
    contexts. Since these conditions filter out certain inputs, these
    objects are called **filters**.

    Originally, filters were defined as ordinary functions. But classes
    have one big advantage: they let us define custom operators, like
    ``&``, ``|``, and ``~``. These operators give us a terse way to
    create more complex conditions, e.g. ``al('hal') & upadha('a')``.
