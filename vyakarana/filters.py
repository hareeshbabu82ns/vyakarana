    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Excluding paribhāṣā, all rules in the Ashtadhyayi describe a context
    then specify an operation to apply based on that context. Within
    this simulator, a rule's context is defined using *filters*, which
    return a true or false value for a given index within some state.

    This module defines a variety of parameterized and unparameterized
    filters, as well as as some basic operators for combining filters.
