    """A collection of all verb roots in the Sanskrit language.

    This class makes it easy to select a continuous range of roots from
    the Dhātupāṭha and query for other properties of interest, such as
    the original gaṇa.

    All data is stored in a CSV file, which is read when the program
    begins.

    The Dhātupāṭha is traditionally given as a list of roots, each
    stated in upadeśa with a basic gloss. An example:

        1.1 bhū sattāyām

    The first number indicates the root gaṇa, of which there are ten.
    This gaṇa determines the form that the root takes when followed by
    :term:`sārvadhātuka` affixes. The second number indicates the root's
    relative position within the gaṇa.

    Although few modern editions of the text have accent markings, the
    Sanskrit grammatical tradition has preserved the original accents
    all of the original items. Per the conventions of SLP1, these are
    written as follows:

    ========  =========  ==========  ====
    Accent    SLP1       Devanagari  IAST
    ========  =========  ==========  ====
    udātta    (no mark)
    anudātta  ``\\``
    svarita   ``^``
    ========  =========  ==========  ====
